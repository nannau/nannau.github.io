title: Design Value Explorer
summary: The Design Value Explorer is tailored to users who would consult the National Building Code of Canada and/or the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code as part of their work, for climate-related design and planning needs.

PCIC’s Design Value Explorer (DVE) enables users to access historical climatic design variables across Canada, in either map or table form, examine projected future change in design variables, and download maps and tables. Climatic design values are used by engineers to determine some elements of the environment that buildings and other infrastructure may be exposed to. This information was produced by PCIC, in collaboration with Environment and Climate Change Canada and the National Research Council, to support updates to the National Building Code of Canada (2015, Table C-2) and the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC/ CSA S6 2014, Annex A3.1). Note that the information provided by DVE has not been fully reviewed and accepted for inclusion into updates to these codes, and thus should only be considered as advisory information.

* For the historical period, Canada-wide maps and Table C-2 entries were created from the optimal interpolation of station observations using a regional climate model.

* For future periods, change maps and Table C-2 entries were created from a regional climate model, covering most of Canada (up to 75°N). Each future projection is characterized by a global warming level in °C above a baseline period (1986-2016).
